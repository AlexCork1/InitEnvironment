# Python Project Template

This is a starter template for Python projects used in GitHub Classroom.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- Basic Python functions in `main.py`
- Unit tests in `test_main.py` using `pytest`
- Automated testing via GitHub Actions
- `requirements.txt` to install dependencies

## How to Run Tests

1. Install dependencies:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run tests locally:
```
pytest
```

## Functions to implement
- return0()
Returns 0.

- returnNTimesA(n, a)
Returns n * a. Currently just returns a. You should implement it.
